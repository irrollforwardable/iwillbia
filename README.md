# Iwillbia (pre-alpha version)
Iwillbia /pronounced [aɪ'wɪlbɪa]/ derived from "I will be", means absolutely nothing, just a cool title in my opinion :)

"Notepady"-looking platformer game involving jumping over the words from the top of any text file in order to reach its end, as well as collecting coins, avoiding the bad guys and trasforming into words of that file.
